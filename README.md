I designed a Prototype Firework Show Creator that is designed to work with a launcher system that has been developed by my brother. 

This prototype works great but apps in Python are limited in their ability to work cross-platform and it still needs to be redone in a better language such as Flutter. I plan on eventually using this app to create my own dataset of firework shows with great ease. Then I can train a model to develop new shows for any song that the user wishes to make a firework show with.
