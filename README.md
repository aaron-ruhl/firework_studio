Prototype Firework Show Creator that is designed to work with a launcher system that has been developed by my brother.

Apps in Python have limited ability to work cross-platform and it still needs to be redone in a better language such as Flutter. I plan on eventually using this app to create my own dataset of firework shows with great ease. Then I can train a model to develop new shows for any song. 

Essentialy, this app just takes advantage of Librosa library numerical analysis tools to make show creation effortless and as easy as highlighting an area and clicking a button. The executable is designed to only work on windows and I reccomend just getting source code and trying it that way.
